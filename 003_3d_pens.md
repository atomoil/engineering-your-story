This is a 3d pen.

You are going to learn to draw with it.

It is not easy, and it will take practice. Please be patient with it and with yourselves.

The most important thing is to **never** touch the nozzle or the plastic near the nozzle. **It is hot and could burn you.**

The plastic is already loaded and you will learn how to change it later. But first, let me show you what it can do.

DEMO VIDEO TK. (From too far, too fast, with stray plastic, how to finish it off)

It uses a motor that needs electricity to turn. Plug it in to your computer, via the usb cord. Everybody got theirs plugged in?

Prop of pen:
* On button, also off
* Extrude button, also retract
* Plastic goes in the top and comes out of the nozzle when it melts.
* It takes a few seconds to solidify, but then it is strong.
* It is magical engineering!

Now we're going to turn it on. The plastic won't come out yet. It's just going to heat up.

Because this is melting plastic, you need to melt it onto a surface that you can remove it from. If you melt the plastic onto paper, the plastic will bond with the paper, like glue, and your creation will not come off easily.

* Practice on the stencil
* Close squiggle lines
* Draw a square, and fill in

Now that you've had a little bit of practice, you're going to make a 3D shape out of 2D shapes.

EXPLANATION TK

* Tree
