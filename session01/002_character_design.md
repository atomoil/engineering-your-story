Art uses a lot of different types of maths.  The first maths element that we are going to explore is shapes and shape theory. Shape theory is the idea that your character's shape has a huge part to play in how people will perceive it.

I'd like you to experiment with the shapes of your characters. Using the spare paper, see if you can exaggerate some of the shapes of your character.
