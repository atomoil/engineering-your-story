## How it works

An engineer wants to know how things work.

Drawing with a 3d pen is not easy, and it will take practice. Whenever you are trying to learn, please be patient with it and with yourselves.

### WARNING

**Never** touch the nozzle or the plastic near the nozzle. **It is hot and could hurt you.**

This is a Polaroid Play 3d pen.

* Plastic goes in the top and **extrudes** or comes out of the nozzle when it melts.
* It takes a few seconds to solidify, but then it is strong.
* It is magical engineering!

Some essential techniques:

* Closeness
* Speed
* Anchoring
* Direction/Rotating

The core principle: you're after big thick blobby lines.

## Let's get started

The gears that push the plastic through the pen use a motor that needs electricity to turn. So, now is the time to plug it in to your computer, via the usb cord. Everybody got theirs plugged in?

You should see a red light, which means it's heating up.

Make sure you've got a sharp end of your filament, make sure it's not been previously melted. If it has a melted end, get a grown up to cut the end with a pair of scissors.

Once the light turns blue, the pen is hot enough, and we can load in the PLA filament by pressing the extrude button.

* Practice the squiggling! [Stencil from 3D Doodler](https://learn.the3doodler.com/stencils/lettering-practice/)

Once you've had some practice, try doing the first letter of your name, or even your whole name. Tip: do the outline of the letter first, then fill in using "lawnmower lines".
